## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v22+
- npm
- Discord bot token
- MySQL/MariaDB database
- yt-dlp (installed automatically in Docker)
- ffmpeg

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OlliePCK/PackBot.git
   cd PackBot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   For Discord voice playback, keep `@discordjs/voice` and `@snazzah/davey` installed so modern encrypted voice channels can negotiate successfully.

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   # Discord
   TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   
   # Database
   MYSQL_HOST=your_mysql_host
   MYSQL_PORT=3306
   MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   MYSQL_DB=your_mysql_database
   
   # APIs (Optional)
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key      # For YouTube notifications
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key    # For voice commands
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id  # For Spotify support
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_secret
   
   # Logging (Optional)
   LOG_LEVEL=info          # debug, info, warn, error
   LOG_FORMAT=text         # text, json
   LOG_COLORS=false        # true/false
   LOG_DIR=logs
   LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB=5
   LOG_MAX_FILES=5
   ```

   Full canonical env reference: `ENVIRONMENT.md`.

4. **Set up the database:**
   
   Option A - Run the migration script:
   ```sh
   node database/migrate.js
   ```
   
   Option B - Run the full schema manually:
   ```sh
   mysql -u your_user -p your_database < database/schema.sql
   ```
   
   This creates the following tables:
   - `Guilds` - Server settings (channels, roles, voice command preferences)
   - `Youtube` - YouTube channel subscriptions
   - `Playtime` - User gaming session tracking
   - `VoiceWhitelist` - Servers enabled for voice commands

5. **Deploy slash commands:**
   ```sh
   node deploy-commands.js
   ```

6. **Start the bot:**
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

## Docker Deployment

### Build and run locally:
```sh
docker build -t packbot .
docker run --env-file .env packbot
```

### Pull from Docker Hub:
```sh
docker pull olliepck/packbot:latest
```

### CI/CD (Automatic DockerHub builds)
This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and pushes the PackBot image to DockerHub on every push to `master`/`main` (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`).

1. Create a DockerHub access token (Account Settings → Security → New Access Token).

## CI/CD Overview (PackBot + PackSite)

You have two separate deployment processes:

### 1) PackBot (Docker image → DockerHub)
This repo builds and pushes the Docker image to DockerHub via:
- `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`

**Required GitHub secrets:**
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

On Unraid you can then pull/update the container using the Unraid Docker UI (or an auto-updater if you prefer).

### 2) PackSite (files → nginx directory on Unraid)
PackSite deploy is done locally (Windows) via a script that runs `vite build` and then uploads the `dist/` output via `scp` to:
`/mnt/user/appdata/binhex-nginx/nginx/html/the-pack/`

**One-time setup:**
```powershell
Copy-Item .\scripts\deploy.config.example.json .\scripts\deploy.config.json
```
Edit `scripts/deploy.config.json` and set `host`, `user`, and `targetPath`.

**Deploy:**
```powershell
./scripts/deploy-packsite.ps1
```

Notes:
- Requires Node.js/npm on your PC.
- Requires `scp` (Windows OpenSSH client).


2. In GitHub → Repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` = your DockerHub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` = your DockerHub access token
3. Push to `master` (or `main`). A new image is published as:
   - `<username>/packbot:latest`
   - `<username>/packbot:sha-<commit>`
4. On Unraid, point the container to `<username>/packbot:latest` and enable automatic updates via CA Auto Update Applications or watchtower.

### Docker Compose example:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  packbot:
    image: olliepck/packbot:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TOKEN=${TOKEN}
      - CLIENT_ID=${CLIENT_ID}
      - MYSQL_HOST=${MYSQL_HOST}
      - MYSQL_PORT=${MYSQL_PORT}
      - MYSQL_USER=${MYSQL_USER}
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_DB=${MYSQL_DB}
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/usr/src/app/logs
      - ./cookies.json:/usr/src/app/cookies.json:ro
```

### Unraid Setup:
Template available at `unraid/my-PackBot.xml`.

1. Add container from Docker Hub: `olliepck/packbot:latest`
2. Add environment variables in container settings
3. Mount `/app/logs` for persistent logs
4. Mount `cookies.json` if needed for age-restricted videos
